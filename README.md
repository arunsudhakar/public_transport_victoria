The `public transport victoria` sensor platform uses the [Public Transport Victoria (PTV)](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/) as a source for public transport departure times for Victoria, Australia.

# Installation (There are two methods, with HACS or manual)

### 1. Easy Mode

Not just yet. ~~We support [HACS](https://hacs.netlify.com/). Go to "STORE", search "Public Transport Victoria" and install.~~
Add this repo as a custom repository within HACS.

### 2. Manual

Install it as you would do with any homeassistant custom component:

1. Download `custom_components` folder.
2. Copy the `public_transport_victoria` directory within the `custom_components` directory of your homeassistant installation.
The `custom_components` directory resides within your homeassistant configuration directory.
**Note**: if the custom_components directory does not exist, you need to create it.
After a correct installation, your configuration directory should look like the following.

    ```
    └── ...
    └── configuration.yaml
    └── custom_components
        └── public_transport_victoria
            └── __init__.py
            └── config_flow.py
            └── const.py
            └── sensor.py
            └── manifest.json
            └── sensor.py
            └── strings.json
            └── PublicTransportVictoria
                └── public_transport_victoria.py
            └── translations
                └── en.json
    ```

  - alias: 'update_trains'
    initial_state: true
